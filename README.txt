Due to security reasons the .json files on the webpage will not load
without being run on a "live server" or in a production environment.

The .json files could be hosted on lottiefiles website, although 
you can only host 10 at a time on a free account. 

Also the website is blocked in MDOC, I left them in the project Due 
to the appeal or aesthetic. 

I have completed almost all of the required elements changed some aspects 
for usability and readability, I had the suggestion to change my about page 
to align the team cards, I was initially going for a staggered look or affect 
so I decided to leave it be.

I have enjoyed Brave Behind Bars 2023, I hope to someday see more options 
like this class offered maybe this being the prerequisite to some more advanced
classes, like a Django or React class. Even a part-2 class where we take these 
skills and build on them to advance the understanding even further. 

The TA's have been wonderful, Faraz is a good teacher and I hope he does great things 
The class really helped me have something to look forward to each week.
